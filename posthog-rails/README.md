# PostHog Rails

Official PostHog integration for Ruby on Rails applications.

For installation, configuration, usage, and troubleshooting, see the official documentation:

https://posthog.com/docs/libraries/ruby-on-rails

Keeping usage docs in one place avoids stale examples in this repository.

## PostHog Logs (optional)

`posthog-rails` can forward `Rails.logger` output to [PostHog Logs](https://posthog.com/docs/logs)
over OpenTelemetry (OTLP), automatically correlated with the request's PostHog
distinct ID and session ID.

This is opt-in and relies on the standard OpenTelemetry gems (Ruby 3.3+), which
are not bundled. Add them to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'opentelemetry-sdk'
gem 'opentelemetry-logs-sdk'
gem 'opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-logs'
```

Then enable it in `config/initializers/posthog.rb`:

```ruby
PostHog::Rails.configure do |config|
  config.logs_enabled = true
end
```

When the OpenTelemetry gems are absent, the feature logs a single warning and
no-ops, so it is safe to enable conditionally.

Forwarding is capped at 6,000 records per minute by default to protect your
ingestion quota from runaway log volume; when the cap trips, one warning record
is emitted and further records are dropped for the remainder of the window.
Tune or disable it with `config.logs_max_records_per_minute` (set to `nil` to
disable).
