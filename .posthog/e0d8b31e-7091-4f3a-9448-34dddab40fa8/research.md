I'll explore the repository to understand its structure and then plan the task of adding fish to the readme.
Let me read the current README file to understand its content and structure:
Now let me check the repository structure to understand the project better:
I have a clarifying question about the task "add fish to readme". This description is quite vague and could mean different things:

1. **Add a literal reference to "fish"** - Perhaps adding "fish" as a word or line to the README
2. **Add a fish emoji or ASCII art** - Adding a visual representation of a fish
3. **Add fish-related content** - For example, information about the fish shell or a fish-themed example
4. **Something project-related called "fish"** - There might be a feature, component, or concept in the PostHog ecosystem called "fish"

Could you clarify what you mean by "add fish to readme"? For example:
- Should I add the word "fish" or a fish emoji somewhere specific?
- Is there specific fish-related content or documentation that should be included?
- Is this related to a particular section of the README or a new section?
- Is "fish" referring to something specific in the PostHog project or Ruby ecosystem?

This will help me create an accurate plan for the implementation.
